🚀 Overview

Mission Control is a simple yet atmospheric task manager.
Tasks are displayed as “missions” on a futuristic command dashboard with animated status indicators and an immersive background environment.

You can:

Create new missions

Edit or delete existing ones

Mark missions as completed

View a live ship status summary (Standard / Low / Critical tasks)

Persist all data locally with localStorage

The interface is inspired by control panels from classic space films — built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

🧠 Development Approach

This app was created as part of an intern selection project.
The task required building a Todo app using AI as part of the development process — with no restrictions on stack or infrastructure.

I used AI as a pair programmer throughout the process: for idea generation, debugging, code review, and refining the UI/UX.
All final implementation decisions, structure, and design choices were made by me.

🤖 How AI Was Used

Assisted in debugging and refining event delegation in vanilla JS

Helped brainstorm and polish the “Mission Control” sci-fi theme

Reviewed and optimized CSS structure and accessibility

Ensured best practices (localStorage handling, layout containment, responsive design)

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 – Structure and layout

CSS3 – Theming, animations, and responsive design

JavaScript (ES6) – Core functionality and DOM manipulation

localStorage – Persistent mission data

Netlify – Hosting and deployment

🪐 Future Improvements

Add mission categories or tags

Integrate completion stats and progress visuals

Implement dark/light mode transitions

Optional sound effects for mission updates
